**Hello**, nice to meet you!🖐

I'm **Arun**, a MERN stack trainer and full-stack developer. I love sharing my knowledge and empowering others. There's nothing better than seeing buggy code transform into awesome websites, apps, or even small components. In this course, I won’t just teach you how to code—I’ll also share tips and tricks that senior developers use, things I learned the hard way through countless challenges. But I’m here to help you succeed and rock your projects from day one!

![boy-code-night](/src/assets/boynightcode.jpg) I'm beyond excited to have you join me in this awesome project-based course—let's build something amazing together!🥳

—I’d love to hear from you! 👋🏻
