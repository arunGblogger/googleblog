Mernix built e-commerce platforms using a variety of modern web technologies to ensure an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly experience. Here’s an overview of the tools and packages I used:

### Frameworks & Libraries:

Powers the entire website with server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routing, ensuring fast performance and SEO optimization.

- **React**: Provides a dynamic and interactive user interface, ensuring smooth component rendering and updating.
- **Zustand**: Simplifies state management, making it easy to handle user actions, cart management, and product data flow across the site.

### Styling:

- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling fast and responsive without writing custom CSS from scratch.
- **TailwindCSS Animate**: Adds simple animations to enhance the user experience without the need for complex CSS or JavaScript.

### Database & ORM:

- **Drizzle ORM**: A lightweight and type-safe ORM, making database interactions more efficient, structured, and secure, while reducing boilerplate code.
- **Neon DB (PostgreSQL)**: A serverless and scalable database that ensures fast query performance and reliability for storing product and user information.

### Authentication & Security:

- **Next-Auth**: Provides secure user authentication with multiple providers (like Google, GitHub, etc.), making login/registration easier to implement.
- **bcrypt**: Secures user data with strong password hashing for maximum security.

### Payments:

- **Stripe**: Integrated for smooth and secure payment processing, ensuring users can complete transactions easily with various payment methods (cards, wallets, etc.).
- **@stripe/react-stripe-js**: Provides Stripe’s payment form with React components, making it simple to integrate and manage payment interactions.

### Forms & Validation:

- **React Hook Form**: Handles form validation and management, making checkout and registration forms lightweight and fast.
- **Zod**: Used for schema validation, ensuring that data submitted by users is properly validated on the front-end.

### UI/UX Enhancements:

- **Radix UI**: Provides accessible and customizable UI components like dialogs, dropdowns, tooltips, and switches, making the site more interactive and user-friendly.
- **Framer Motion**: Adds smooth animations for page transitions and interactive elements, enhancing the overall user experience.
- **Lottie-React**: Uses Lottie animations to create engaging and attractive visuals on the site.
- **Embla Carousel**: Provides a sleek and smooth carousel for product displays, improving the browsing experience.
- **Recharts**: Used for displaying analytics or sales data in a clear and interactive way using charts.

### Search & Autocomplete:

- **Algolia Search & Autocomplete**: Adds a fast and responsive search feature with instant product suggestions, helping users quickly find what they’re looking for.

### File Uploads:

- **UploadThing**: Simplifies file uploading for product images or user documents, making it easy to manage media files efficiently.

### Other Utilities:

- **Date-fns**: Helps with date manipulation, particularly useful for order tracking and delivery estimates.
- **Lucide Icons & React Icons**: Provide lightweight, customizable icons that improve the UI's visual appeal.
- **clsx**: A utility for conditionally joining class names, making styling more flexible.

### Development & Testing:

- **Drizzle Kit**: Automates database migrations and schema management, ensuring smooth updates during development.
- **ESLint & TypeScript**: Ensure the codebase is clean, error-free, and type-safe, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable project.

### Deployment:
